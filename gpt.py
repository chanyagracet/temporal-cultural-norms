Social emotions are emotions that depend on one's appraisal or consideration of another person's thoughts, feelings, or actions. For this task, the social emotions of interest are **shame**, **guilt**, **embarrassment**, **pride**, and **hubris**. Below are definitions of these emotions: 
\n\n
* **Shame**: A highly unpleasant self-conscious emotion arising from the sense of there being something dishonorable, immodest, or indecorous in one's own conduct or circumstances. 

* **Guilt**: A self-conscious emotion characterized by a painful appraisal of having done (or thought) something that is wrong and often by a readiness to take action designed to undo or mitigate this wrong. It is distinct from shame, in which there is the additional strong fear of one's deeds being publicly exposed to judgment or ridicule. 

* **Embarrassment**: A self-conscious emotion in which a person feels awkward or flustered in other people's company or because of the attention of others, such as when being observed. 

* **Pride**: is a self-conscious emotion that occurs when a goal has been attained and one's achievement has been recognized and approved by others. It differs from joy and happiness in that these emotions do not require the approval of others to be experienced. 

* **Hubris** is arrogant pride or presumption. Overconfidence is a synonym of hubris.
